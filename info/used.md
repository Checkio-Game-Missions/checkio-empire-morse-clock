**How it is used:**

Did you play the binary clocks mission earlier?
This can be the basis for a fun gift for any geek.
We've tried to combine the Morse code with a binary clock 
for this task and now you can create the new more complex binary clock, one which doesn't just tell time -- 
but makes morse style bips and beeps. ;-)
