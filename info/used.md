**How it is used:**

Did you see the binary clocks task earlier?
This is can be a fun gift for any geek.
We tried to combine the old good Morse code with a binary clock in this task,
and now you can create the new more complex binary clock,
which doesn't show time -- but makes morse style bips and beeps. ;-)
