**How it is used:**

Did you play the binary clocks mission earlier?
This can be the basis for a fun gift for any geek.
Now we've remixed the binary clock idea with Morse Code.
Now you can create an even more complex binary clock, one which doesn't just tell time -- 
but makes morse style bips and beeps. ;-)
